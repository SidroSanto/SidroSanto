series asks artists to reflect on their relationship with the music they love and share stories about how it has influenced their lives. Here, Jess Day raises a glass to Paramore’s third album, Brand New Eyes (2009).

Four years and close to a dozen singles after her debut, Adelaide singer-songwriter Jess Day has released the EP, The Lovers (Reversed). The EP represents two years’ worth of personal and creative growth for Day. “I hope these tales of heartbreak, melancholy and triumph make some of its listeners feel seen and validated,” Day said in a statement.

Jess Day’s Love Letter to Paramore’s Brand New Eyes

Jess Day: The first track, ‘Careful’, shattered my brain. The snare and distortion quite honestly sent me into another realm. My life was changed forever. Then, the chorus. Hayley Williams’ vocals sent a shooting shiver down my spine and made my eyes well up. I’d never had this kind of physiological response to music before.

There’s an authenticity in her vocal delivery that made me feel like I would believe anything she said. I waited for the next song, expecting to do the usual thing of skipping two, listening to one, skip another couple, listen to one. This entire album had my undivided attention and I hung on to every new section with ravenous desperation.

My 80GB iPod Classic was at maximum volume, the high end leaking from the holes on the outsides of the earphones. My ears could’ve been bleeding but I didn’t care. By ‘Brick By Boring Brick’, I was a changed person.

I’d been exposed to Avril Lavigne, classic rock and softer forms of pop punk. But this was something else. There was an angst inside it and the instrumentation tickled my brain in a way I hadn’t felt before. It also really opened me up to the world of post-hardcore and metalcore.
